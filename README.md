# Goal： Shorten preparation time.
We need this manual to be written in both Chinese and English too.
## Life
Something, target is SIST students.(Like sleep early and get up early XD)

## Preparation
### English
Prepare for IELTS reading, listening and speaking. Try to reach two 7s in reading and listening.
### Math
Prepare a little bit for Calculus. (Until Taylor Expansion?)
### Computer
BaseLine: Let the newborn know there needs.
Software(Linux/git/latex/...), Hardware(Apple/Thinkpad/Other, i3/5/7, A/N GPU...anything else?)
TBD if we provide some suggestions for computers, if so, we may risk being advertising for some OEM.

These are the baselines, if cannot finish these in two months, you might reconsider your choice to join ShanghaiTech.( But reading this means you no longer have choice anymore :) )

## Guideline for Self-teaching(Important)
